## I would love to tell you our story

What are you waiting for?! Our Pop Up Restaurants have been open for over a year, so what are you waiting
            for?!
            Local chefs are featured in the most unique dining locations in the Waterloo Area.
            You should expect a gourmet 1-5 course meal with live music, entertainment, tasteful decor, take-home
            treats, and, of course, a social atmosphere.
            We can build personalised private Pop Up Restaurants for you and your friends. Let us take care of the
            preparation so you don't have to!
            We'll go over the specifics with you ahead of time, and then all you have to do is turn up and enjoy the
            evening with your guests.
            Birthday celebrations, engagement parties, wedding dinners, baby showers, and more can all be held in a
            private pop-up!
